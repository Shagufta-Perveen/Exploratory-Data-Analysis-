Exploratory Data Analysis in R | Customer Behavior Dataset
# 🧠 Customer Behavior EDA and Feature Engineering in R

This project explores a **Customer Behavior dataset** using R, focusing on data preprocessing and feature engineering as part of a research assignment.

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Customer Behavior Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/denisadutca/customer-behaviour)
- Contains demographic info, purchase patterns, and behavioral indicators.

## 📊 Key Components

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Descriptive statistics
- Visualizations (histograms, box plots, scatter plots)
- Variable types and data structure

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values (imputation & removal)
- Outlier detection and filtering using IQR
- Data transformation: standardization, log transform
- Data cleaning: text normalization (e.g., gender values)

### 3. Feature Engineering
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** = Frequency × AvgPurchase
- **Recency** = Days since last purchase

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- R
- `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `lubridate`

## 📄 Output
- Final R Markdown file (`.Rmd`) with all steps documented
- Rendered HTML/PDF report

## 📌 Purpose
This project is part of a semester-long research assignment focused on improving customer segmentation and understanding behavioral trends through real-world datasets.
